#### A browser extension that adds a `Close tab` entry to the page context menu

Available for [Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/closetab/lnchemdcmhoccciihokpdkkekmnejfhj) and [Opera](https://addons.opera.com/en/extensions/details/closetab/).

The menu item shortcut key is customizable in case the default (C) collides with that of another menu item.

#### Why is this useful?

CloseTab enables you to close a web page in a snap with a right mouse click anywhere on the page followed by a left-handed key press, rather than moving the mouse cursor to the relatively small click target presented by the page tab's close icon and clicking it.

This works well with the dual keyboard/mouse hand positioning commonly employed during web browser engagement, as depicted in this professionally-rendered illustration:
